# Repository Overview

The Embedded System Design lab projects involve integrating a wide spectrum of hardware-software elements with massive integration of MCUs, memories, PLDs, etc. while equal emphasis is laid on the software elements that drive the system (e.g. Interrupts, Schedulers, Timers, Peripheral interfaces, etc.). The course capstone project will use over-the-air data transmission mechanism to send refined and reliable data to a cloud foundry for providing cloud services. The project stretches from a simple PCB design to a completely working prototype of a system delivering quality service.
